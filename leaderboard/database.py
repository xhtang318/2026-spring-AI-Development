# Lecture 3 helpers (same schema as lecture 2 — reuse the same functions)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Lecture 3 uses the same table schema as lecture 2: (team_name, resume_id) keying.
# The only difference is the DB file path and which CSV provides valid IDs.
# Reuse init_db, add_submission, get_all_submissions, delete_submission,
# delete_team_submissions, and reset_db with LECTURE3_DB_PATH.
