### Lecture 4 (AI Agents & Tool Use)
- **Topic**: Building an Application Routing Agent
- **Slides**: [lecture_4.pdf](lecture_4/slides/lecture_4.pdf)
- **Notebook**: `lecture_4/notebooks/lecture_4_application_routing_agent.ipynb`
- **Data**: `lecture_4/data/resumes_final.csv` (130 resumes), `lecture_4/data/job_req_senior.md`
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Understanding AI agents and the agent loop (Observe → Think → Act)
  - Tool registries and function calling
  - Multi-turn decision making with action history
  - Action logging and observability
  - The tool ecosystem (MCP, agents.txt, skills/plugins)
  - Production considerations: safety, reliability, monitoring
  - Common failure modes (infinite loops, tool hallucination, premature completion)
  - Ethical considerations (bias, transparency, accountability)
  - Human-in-the-loop design patterns
- **Teaching Examples**:
  - Weather query agent (3-turn example showing context evolution)
  - Ralph Wiggum plugin (preventing premature completion)
- **Hands-on**: Build an agent that routes job applications through multiple decision points
  - Extract candidate features (years, skills, education) using Lecture 3 techniques
  - Implement 7 tools: schedule assessments, reject applications, flag for review, send emails, etc.
  - Build the agent decision function and agent loop
  - Analyze results with pandas DataFrames
  - **Task 1**: Calculate costs for 3 candidates and estimate for 130
  - **Task 2**: Experiment with temperature settings (0.2, 0.5, 1.0)
  - **Task 3**: Run on full dataset of 130 candidates and verify cost estimates

## Running notebooks (per lecture) 

Each lecture directory contains a `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, and `pyproject.toml`.

From a lecture directory (e.g. `lecture_2/`):
- `make build`
- `make notebook` (starts Jupyter in Docker on port 8888)
- `make interactive` (drops you into a bash shell in the container)
